  MineCalc
A forge mod that will introduce a calculator in the game. Usage is /calc [number] [symbol] [number], with an infinite number of extra {symbol} {number} groups being appendable. Current symbols are: '+, -, *, /, %, ^, /-'.
  Developing
Run Setup-eclipse.bat to set up the workspace for eclipse. Then open your preferred eclipse workspace, go to Import, General, Existing Projects into Workspace, finally select MineCalc as your root directory and hit Finish.
Running Build.bat will build MineCalc into a .jar a normal forge installation can run. runClient.bat and runServer.bat will open a minecraft client/server with MineCalc installed.
  Eclipse Formatting
I would appreciate if you used my Java format prefs, which can be found at \src\main\java\Blackop778\MineCalc\ and are called EclipseFormatPrefs.xml. Note you can enable Project Specific Settings if you don't like my format preferences. To enable my prefs open Eclipse, then right click on the main window and select Preferences, 2nd from the bottom. Next expand the Editor tab on the left pane, next click Save Actions and at least enable Format source code, but enabling others would be appreciated. Next click the Formatter link and Import my format from the path above. Finally hit ok. Thanks :)
