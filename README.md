#[MineCalc](http://www.curseforge.com/projects/238890/)
A forge mod that will introduce a calculator in the game. Usage (where <> denotes optional and [] is required) is `/calc <boolean: use OOPS> [number][symbol][number]<symbol><number>`, with an infinite number of extra `<symbol><number>` groups being appendable. Current symbols are: `+, -, *, /, %, ^, /--`. There are also `special "numbers"` in this mod. `PI` will be read as the `Math.PI` value of PI, `E` will be read as the `Math.E` value of Euler's Number, and `L` will be read as the last output the user recieved.

##Development
Run `Setup-eclipse.bat` to set up the workspace for eclipse. Then open your preferred eclipse workspace, go to `Import`, `General`, `Existing Projects into Workspace`, finally select `MineCalc` as your root directory and hit `Finish`. Running `Build.bat` will build MineCalc into a .jar a normal forge installation can run. `runClient.bat` and `runServer.bat` will open a minecraft client/server with MineCalc installed.

##Eclipse Formatting
I would appreciate if you used my Java format prefs, which can be found at `\EclipseFormatter.xml`. Note you can enable Project Specific Settings if you don't like my format preferences. To enable my prefs open Eclipse, then right click on the main window and select `Preferences`, 2nd from the bottom. Next expand the `Editor` tab on the left pane, next click `Save Actions` and at least enable `Format source code`, but enabling others would be appreciated. Next click the `Formatter` link and `Import` my format from the path above. Finally hit `ok`. Thanks :)
