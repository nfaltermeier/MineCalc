# [MineCalc](http://www.curseforge.com/projects/238890/)
A forge mod that will introduce a calculator in the game. Usage (where <> denotes optional and [] is required) is `/calc <boolean: use OOPS> [number][symbol][number]<symbol><number>`, with an infinite number of extra `<symbol><number>` groups being appendable. Current symbols are: `+, -, *, /, %, ^, /--`. There are also `special "numbers"` in this mod. `PI` will be read as the `Math.PI` value of PI, `E` will be read as the `Math.E` value of Euler's Number, and `L` will be read as the last output the user recieved.

## Development
Running `gradlew tasks` in your system's terminal (exact syntax may vary) will reveal many of the options available to you. I recomment running `gradlew setupDecompWorkspace` then `gradlew idea` or `gradlew eclipse` to setup your IDE. This will download all the required Minecraft and other libraries needed for compiling and running. You can then open the repository as an Eclipse or Intellij IDEA project directly without having to import anything.
